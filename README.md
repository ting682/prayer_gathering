# Prayer gathering

This is a Ruby on Rails app that is intended for a user to host a prayer gathering. This app includes validations for time and prayers to be submitted for the prayer gathering. The models use a many to many relationship for prayers and gatherings. Each gathering contains a meetup time that is validated with time zones and contains form fields for addresses which are stored in the postgreSQL database. A demo of this app can be found [here](https://prayergathering.herokuapp.com/). 

A youtube video walkthrough can be found below.
