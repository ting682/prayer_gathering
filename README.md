# Prayer gathering

This is a Ruby on Rails app that is intended for a user to host a prayer gathering. This app has the following features:

* Utilizes model-view-controller design pattern resulting in separation of concerns.
* Validates login and event data by creating Rails validation models to ensure persisted data validity.
* Establishes ActiveRecord many-to-many associations to create join table resulting in object relational mapping of data persisted to postgreSQL database.
* Encrypts user login data persisting salted and hashed password in postgreSQL database.

A demo of this app can be found [here](https://prayergathering.herokuapp.com/). 

A youtube video walkthrough can be found below.
